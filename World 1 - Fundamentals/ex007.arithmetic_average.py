# Develop a script that reads two student's grades, calculates them and prints their average:

number1 = float(input('Enter the first grade: '))
number2 = float(input('Enter the second grade: '))
average = (number1 + number2) / 2
print('The first grade is {}, the second grade is {} and the average is {}'.format(number1, number2, average))
