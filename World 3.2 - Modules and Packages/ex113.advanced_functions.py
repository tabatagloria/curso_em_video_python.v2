# Rewrite the readInt() function we made in challenge 104, now including the possibility of typing an invalid number type. Also, create a readFloat() function with the same functionality.

import functions

n1 = functions.readInt(0)
n2 = functions.readFloat(0)


print(f'The integer entered was {n1} and the real number was {n2:.2f}.')
